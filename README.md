# It's Bin Night!
A little Raspberry PI Pico project to display LEDs to indicate when bin night is and what bin's to put out. This one is for the Vale of the White Horse's collections, however, it's pretty easy to modify it for your local collections.

# Overview
After 1800 on bin night, the code will trigger an LED to switch on that will indicate whether to put out recycling or normal rubbish. That's it - pretty simple!
